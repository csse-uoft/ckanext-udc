The indicator can be evaluated by looking at information about the data model and format, verifying that the standard used is appropriate for the domain and the type of digital object. Deciding on the appropriateness of the knowledge representation may be based on its inclusion in a registry like the one developed by FAIR-sharing."
Maturity Level 4 (FAIR),maturity_level_4,content,Data uses machine-understandable knowledge representation (RDA-I1-02D),This indicator focuses on the machine-understandability aspect of the data. This means that data should be readable and thus interoperable for machines without any requirements such as specific translators or mappings (FAIR ID = RDA-I1-02D).,"This indicator is linked to the following principle: I1: (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. This indicator can be evaluated by looking at the knowledge representation model used for the expression of the data. Examples are RDF, OWL, JSON-LD, Data Cube, the Generalized Data Model for clinical research and SKOS. Information about models and formats can be looked up in a registry like the RDA endorsed FAIR-sharing (see for example: https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:model/format)."
Maturity Level 4 (FAIR),maturity_level_4,content,Data uses FAIR-compliant vocabularies (RDA-I2-01D),"The indicator requires the controlled vocabulary used for the data to conform to the FAIR principles, and at least be documented and resolvable using globally unique and persistent identifiers.

The FAIR principle refers mostly to automated interactions where a machine is able to access the digital object, but there may also be digital objects that require human interactions, such as clicking on a link on a landing page, sending an e-mail to the data owner, or even calling by telephone. This indicator is linked to the following principle: A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communication protocol. The indicator can be evaluated by looking for information in the metadata that describes how access to the digital object can be obtained through human intervention."
Maturity Level 4 (FAIR),maturity_level_4,access,Data identifier resolves to a digital object (RDA-A1-03D),Data identifier resolves to a digital object (FAIR ID = RDA-A1-03D),This indicator is about the resolution of the identifier that identifies the digital object. The identifier assigned to the data should be associated with a formally defined retrieval/resolution mechanism that enables access to the digital object or provides access instructions for access in the case of human-mediated access. The FAIR principle and this indicator do not say anything about the mutability or immutability of the digital object that is identified by the data identifier -- this is an aspect that should be governed by a persistence policy of the data provider. This indicator is linked to the following principle: A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communication protocol. The indicator can be evaluated by invoking the mechanism specific to the protocol (e.g. GET for HTTP) and verifying that this delivers the digital object.
Maturity Level 4 (FAIR),maturity_level_4,access,Data is accessible through a standardised protocol (RDA-A1-04D),The indicator refers to automated interactions between machines to access digital objects. The way machines interact and grant access to the digital object will be evaluated by the indicator (FAIR ID = RDA-A1-04D).,"This indicator is linked to the following principle: A1: (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communication protocol. This indicator can be evaluated by resolving the link to the data, e.g. by resolving the persistent identifier and verifying that the data is reached. In the common case that the identifier is an HTTP URI, this can be done using the HTTP GET method. The evaluator or evaluation tool may also want to verify that the resolution delivers the correct data."
Maturity Level 4 (FAIR),maturity_level_4,access,Data can be accessed automatically (RDA-A1-05D),"Data can be accessed automatically (i.e. by a computer program, FAIR ID = RDA-A1-05D)","The indicator refers to automated interactions between machines to access digital objects.
